overview:
    - As part of the rider app redesign, I owned global signup and login.
    - Prior to the redesign, we knew that our existing funnels were cluttered with information and struggling to meet the needs of new markets as we expanded globally.
    - I proposed that we create a modular platform that would enable customizable funnels by market. This would entail breaking down our existing steps into simple, bite-sized screens that could be easily re-arranged, would decrease the cognitive load on users, and would enable easier experimentation.
    - After testing an early Framer prototype in India and China, we were confident in the direction and decided to move forward.
    - We went on to create a comprehensive onboarding platform that featured visually consistent layouts, buttery animations, and would intelligently route riders to signup or login based on their phone number.
outcome:
    - There’s been a sustained double-digit increase in funnel conversion since the new experience launched. It was a great success.
    - Multiple teams at Uber have used the platform to create localized onboarding experiences, systems for fighting fraud, and new payment experiences.
tools:
    - Sketch, Framer, After Effects

![Main signup and login flow](../images/signup/signup-flow-1.png){: .post-image}
Signup from phone number, login from phone number, and login from email.

Calling this project “Signup” is probably an over-simplification.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Our product required that we create flows covering signup from phone number (the ideal scenario), login from phone number (also an ideal scenario), as well as login from email (a fallback for riders with new phone numbers), and signup while “reclaiming” a mobile number (if your number had been previously registered by someone else).
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

In addition to these flows, we also had to account for fraud fighting features, social login methods, and various permission requests.

In all, the system ended up having around 40 screens, which were then versioned into multiple languages.

All screens in the system were created from 8 base layouts that were designed to minimize on-screen information, maintain visual consistency, and make internationalization easy.

Since we opted to have more steps in our signup flow in favor of less information density, creating the illusion of speed through motion was a key design principle.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

I designed and prototyped various motion directions to make the signup and login experience feel fluid, fast, and delightful. The animation of our circular continue button matches the animation treatment for the circular shortcut buttons riders would later encounter on the home screen.
