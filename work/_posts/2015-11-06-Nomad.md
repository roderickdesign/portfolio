overview:
    - As a frequent traveler, I always struggle to remember the hidden gems I find on my trips.
    - If you asked me where I found the best vegetarian food in Ahmedabad or which locals-only beach in Nicaragua I liked best, I wouldn’t be able to give you a name or location, although my memories of the experiences are vivid.
    - It’s these adventures and the ability to share them with those you love that make travel worth it.
    - Nomad is an ongoing personal project that aims to solve this problem by giving you a central place to catalogue the places you visit and share them with friends seeking similar adventures. It makes saving, sending, and receiving trip itineraries and recommendations easy.
outcome:
    - No outcome yet, as this is an ongoing project.
    - However, in the process of pursuing this project I’ve opened the door to the world of Swift and iOS development, so in that sense it’s already a great success.
tools:
    - Sketch, Swift

Nomad is centered around a simple mechanic: creating a collection and adding places to it.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Adding a place to a collection is done best in real time, as we use location information to surface the place you're most likely at. However, if you forget to add a place, you can search for it after the fact. Custom location creation is also available for places that are off the grid.

Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.

The Nomad sharing experience. Sender experience (top) and receiver experience (bottom).
{: .post-caption}

Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.
